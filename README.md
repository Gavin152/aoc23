# My Repo of Advent of Code 2023

Let's see how far I can make it this year until my interest swelters

## Here are the commands to get this running

The project's written in TypeScript. Install the dependencies first:
```
npm install
```

Each day has its own branch, and there's an 'a' and 'b' variant, reflecting the two parts of every day's puzzles. Simply checkout the branch of interest and run 
```
npm run start <example|puzzle>
```

The `<example|puzzle>` is an argument that points towards the data input file (located in the data folder).
